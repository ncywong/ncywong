title: About

I am an engineering graduate student at [University of Cambridge](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) specializing in computational engineering at the [computational design group](https://www-edc.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/computationaldesign/). I have been working on compressive sensing, sensitivity analysis and dimension reduction, with applications in turbomachinery engineering problems.

This site will include some notes of what I learn.

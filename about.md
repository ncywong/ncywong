This is a site where I (aim to) put notes from my reading and learning. They will mainly pertain to quantitative subjects. It will also serve as an "about me" page for any portfolio worth displaying in the future...

I am an engineering graduate student specializing in computational engineering. I have been working on compressive sensing, sensitivity analysis and dimension reduction, with applications in aerothermal engineering problems. There will probably be a CV here, soon...

My hobbies include Chinese instrument music, Japanese animation, and writing. *Those looking for me writing about something else should be looking at another link...*
